#DFT-CES quantum-espresso(QE) example

1. The XX.out files are output files from QE of DFT-CES.
(The unit is conventional units in QE)
2. The "v_b+h+ion+saw+wat.avg" is the total electrostatic potential profiles in QE. It is sum of bare potential, hartree potential of valance electrons, MD potential, dipole correction potential.

<Procedures for deriving solute.cube>
#The solute.cube file is the QE potential file to apply the potential during the MD.
#In case of neutral system, it can be directly extracted from PP module. 
(in case of dipole correction, it should be more careful... please read source PP file attached in other repository)
# If the system has excess charges, it should follow the below procedures.
1. Subtract valanceElectrons_notNeutral and valanceElectrons_notNeutral = "val-refval_rho.cube"
2. Subtract net charges as point charges at atomic position in "val-refval_rho.cube" = "val-refval-pointQ_rho.cube"
3. Then, the ""val-refval-pointQ_rho.cube" is neutral.
4. So after dipole correction, the electrostatic potential can be derived by solving Poisson's equation.
5. Add the neutral potential of original system(bare+hartree potential).
6. The subtracted point charges are assigned to the same atomic positions of MD system.
7. To make consistent, the long-range Coulomb solver of MD system should be the "pppm"
